## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Use media query and change background-image in mobile screen. And I got a comment 'use CSS grid/flex and rem/em units' in my previous work, so I use them this time.

### Continued development

simplify my CSS code more!

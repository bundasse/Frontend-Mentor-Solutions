## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS

### What I learned

Use SCSS!
first time I tried to use tailwind css, but had trouble in using media query. sometimes I got lost in a maze of braces, but nesting and variables of SCSS was really really great!

### Continued development

- how to control SVG files.
I read some articles about SVG file color change, but could not understand yetüòû. So I want to study with other challenger's answer.
